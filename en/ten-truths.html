                <p class="article-intro">Personal growth is not made of great revolutions, but of small daily steps. Each of us carries within doubts, fragilities and desires for change. Yet, we often forget that true strength is born from acceptance. Here are ten truths that can become your starting point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <h2>1. You are not wrong. You are a human being, imperfect and unique.</h2>
                <p>How many times have you felt "not enough"? The truth is that there is no manual that defines perfection. Your uniqueness is your strength. Every imperfection tells a story, and that story is yours alone.</p>

                <h2>2. Your value doesn't depend on what you do.</h2>
                <p>You are not a list of achieved goals or successes to display. Your value is intrinsic: you exist, you breathe, you live. That's enough. You don't have to prove anything to deserve love and respect.</p>

                <h2>3. You don't have to please everyone.</h2>
                <p>Your energy is not universal, and it doesn't have to be. You are not a coin that must have the same value for everyone. You are a magnetic field: you will attract those who are in tune with you, and that's okay.</p>

                <h2>4. Your mistakes don't define you.</h2>
                <p>Mistakes are not labels, but lessons. They teach you, shape you, make you more aware. They are not your identity, but tools for growth.</p>

                <h2>5. Your needs matter.</h2>
                <p>How many times have you set them aside to please others? Listening to them is an act of love towards yourself. It's not weakness, it's strength: recognizing what you need makes you more authentic.</p>

                <h2>6. Saying no doesn't make you selfish.</h2>
                <p>A sincere "no" is an act of freedom. It means respecting your boundaries and protecting your energy. Saying no to others sometimes means saying yes to yourself.</p>

                <h2>7. Comparing yourself with others distances you from yourself.</h2>
                <p>Your path is not a race. Constantly looking at who runs beside you makes you lose sight of your own pace. Your life is a unique journey, and deserves to be lived without comparisons.</p>

                <h2>8. The body you have deserves respect.</h2>
                <p>It's not an enemy to fight, but your home. It accompanies you every day, supports you, allows you to live experiences. Inhabit it with kindness, not judgment.</p>

                <h2>9. Talk to yourself as you would to a friend.</h2>
                <p>The words you use with yourself have enormous power. If you criticize yourself, you hurt yourself. If you encourage yourself, you lift yourself up. You deserve the same sweetness you give to others.</p>

                <h2>10. Loving yourself is not a destination.</h2>
                <p>It's not a goal to reach once and for all, but a daily practice. Every day you can choose to treat yourself with care, to respect yourself, to welcome yourself. Start today, and do it again tomorrow.</p>
